# Haru 6502 Assembler
This is a compact tool designed to convert ASM code to byte opcodes and vice versa. It was developed entirely by me to quickly convert my NES 6502 Assembly code into bytes that I can insert in the NES ROM on the fly, and work in reverse to help me understand existing assembly routines.
